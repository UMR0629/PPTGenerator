1) PREDATOR can detect 26 previously unknown vulnera-
bilities in real-world applications and so far seven have
been confirmed and patched by their vendors.

2) This paper expands the field of directed fuzzing (which
has been shown to be difficult in other domains) to web
application fuzzing.

3) This paper will open-source the system, thus allowing
future researchers to build on this work.
