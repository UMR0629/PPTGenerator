4.3.1. Block Distance Supplementation. Inaccurate static
analysis results caused by variable function calls can be
supplemented during dynamic testing. PREDATOR can dy-
namically identify paths that were not recognized during the
static analysis phase and update the block distances accord-
ingly. The simplified workflow is shown in Algorithm 2.
