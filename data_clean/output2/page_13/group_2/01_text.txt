In this section, we showcase the capability of PREDATOR
to detect new vulnerabilities in real-world web applications.
We include 22 popular web applications from previous
work [6, 12, 15, 16, 38] and select the latest versions that
are compatible with PHP 7. We first analyze the applications
using TChecker, subsequently providing the potential vulner-
able targets to PREDATOR for automated dynamic validation.
We set the time budget to 24 hours for each application.
The dataset, static analysis reports, and results after dynamic
validation by PREDATOR are > summarized 1 in Table 7.
