We discovered that TChecker encountered errors when
analyzing certain applications, such as ForkCMS and Suite-
CRM. This limitation pertains to the static analysis tool used,
rather than to PREDATOR. Moreover, it is important to note
that the current XSS detector inherently has the potential for
false positives, which is a limitation due to implementation
issues. Developing more advanced detectors could overcome
this limitation.
