Function Calls. When executing a function call opcode,
PREDATOR detects the control flow transfer. The process of
handling distance information is similar to that used for jump
opcodes. Additionally, PREDATOR records the filename and
line number of the call sites to dynamically update imprecise
block distances, which will be detailed in ยง4.3.1.
