The simplified workflow is shown in Algorithm |. Specif-
ically, we first identify all branch statements (BS) along the
control flow paths that extend from the entry scripts to the
specified target. For each branch statement in BS, we extract
all request parameters into RP and add the ones that influence
the condition expressions to the dictionary DP by tracing the
data-flow path backward. We then analyze the AST nodes
along the path to extract all possible values of the request
parameters and store them in V, specifically extracting all
relevant right-hand values from assignments, conditional
statements, efc. Finally, we append all these possible values
together with the request parameters into the dictionary DR.
Take the code in Listing | as an example. The server-side
