Script Inclusion Chain Analysis. We assess the script
inclusion chain to identify which scripts include the entry
scripts, consequently designating those as entry scripts as
well. Then, we convert the file system paths of the entry
scripts into entry URLs. They are then fed into the fuzzer
to indicate the scripts responsible for processing test cases.
