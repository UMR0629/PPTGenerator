input corpus. We compare PREDATOR with Witcher on their
throughputs to examine the impact of selective dynamic
instrumentation. We run each tool for one hour on every
entry URL of each application and take the average as the
throughput, measured in requests per second (req/s). The
dataset contains 10 web applications, excluding those where
neither PREDATOR nor Witcher identified any vulnerabilities.
