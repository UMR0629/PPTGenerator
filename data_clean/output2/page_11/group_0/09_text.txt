Results. The results are shown in Table 5. The distance
calculation time is negligible for most applications, except
for OpenEMR, which has a large codebase. The cost for
identifying entry URLs and constructing the input corpus is
also low, except for OpenEMR and ECShop. The time spent
on static analysis is typically less than 1 hour, demonstrating
that it is both fast and scalable. We analyze the relative
difference in fuzzing throughput between PREDATOR and
Witcher. PREDATORâ€™s throughput relative to Witcher ranges
