Results. The average time to exposure (u7TTE) is shown
in Table 4. We used the Mann-Whitney U test to assess
the statistical significance of our experimental results. In
22 out of 25 cases, the results are statistically significant,
with p-values less than 0.05. In the other 3 cases, both tools
either failed to detect the vulnerability, resulting in a 24-
hour TTE, or they triggered the vulnerabilities within similar
timeframes in multiple trials, yielding higher p-values.
