Witcher on the efficiency. The comparison was exclusively
made with Witcher because PREDATOR is implemented atop
Witcher, and it significantly differs from the other tools.
Additionally, Cefuzz neither has available source code nor an
evaluation of time to exposure in its paper, thus we are unable
to compare PREDATOR with it. While we acknowledge that
comparing PREDATOR, a directed fuzzer, to Witcher may
seem unfair, it is important to note that our intention is not
to criticize Witcher. Rather, our goal is to emphasize the
advantages of directed fuzzing for web applications. We
select vulnerabilities in real-world applications that could be
successfully triggered and allocate a 24-hour time budget
for each one and run the experiment ten times. Moreover,
to enhance fairness as much as possible, we provide both
tools with the same input corpus and entry URLs, and set
the initial seeds to be empty.
