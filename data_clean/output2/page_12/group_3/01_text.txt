We further assess the capability of PREDATOR in validat-
ing static analysis reports. We use the set of vulnerabilities
reported by TChecker [6] as the ground truth, and then
perform automatic validation using PREDATOR. We set
the locations reported by TChecker as the targets. Some
applications evaluated by TChecker are excluded, and we
provide detailed explanations in Table 8 in the appendix.
