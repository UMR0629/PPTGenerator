Table 6 summarizes the number of vulnerabilities re-
ported by TChecker, validated by PREDATOR, and not
validated by PREDATOR. PREDATOR successfully validated
65 out of 84 vulnerabilities (77.38%) reported by TChecker.

False Negatives. We analyze the reasons behind the false
negatives. In Codiad, 5 targets are non-functional because
they rely on the official Marketplace, which has been offline
long ago. If we exclude the 5 targets in Codiad, the ratio
of validated vulnerabilities increases to 82.28%. WebChess
contains multiple vulnerabilities within the same function.
When the first vulnerability was encountered, a segmentation
fault signal was sent to AFL. AFL then believed that the
application just crashed, and did not test subsequent code
to validate the 3 remaining vulnerabilities. In WeBid, one
target requires a valid database name, which is difficult
for the fuzzer to generate randomly. In the case of Joomla,
PREDATOR could not extract the corresponding entry URLs.
Since PREDATOR detects only reflected XSS vulnerabilities
