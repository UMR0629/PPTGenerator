from the target locations and tracing Oack LO the entry Scripts.

PHP’s inclusion mechanism alters the execution flow
by dynamically injecting additional scripts into the runtime
environment. Code in a script might be executed by other
scripts that include it through statements like requireO and
included). For a given target, an intuitive approach is to
consider all scripts that ultimately include the target’s script
as entry scripts. However, this approach is too coarse-grained
and considered impractical, as a script can be recursively
included by other scripts. It could result in a large number
of potential entry scripts, although many of them do not lead
to the target code location.
