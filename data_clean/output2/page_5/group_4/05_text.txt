We propose to use call chain and script inclusion chain
analysis to determine which scripts receive user requests and
direct to the target code locations. This process leverages
the principle that if a target is in a function body, tracing the
call chain can pinpoint the entry functions that initiate the
execution. Essentially, a call chain provides a roadmap of
function calls, detailing each step from the entry functions to
the target. The script inclusion chain analysis then identifies
only the scripts that include the known entry scripts.

Call Chain Analysis. We trace the call chain backward
from the target to determine which scripts originally initiate
