Dynamic analysis methods, such as black-box scan-
ning [12-14] and grey-box fuzzing [15-19], aim to identify
vulnerabilities by executing the application and observing
its behavior. Witcher [16] leverages AFL [20] to detect SQL
injection and command injection vulnerabilities for web
applications in multiple languages. By converting semantic
errors into segmentation fault signals detectable by AFL
through customized bug oracles, it enhances the effectiveness
of detecting injection vulnerabilities. Concurrent to our work,
Atropos [18] employs a snapshot-based, feedback-driven
fuzzing method tailored for PHP-based web applications. It
introduces a feedback mechanism to automatically infer the
key-value structure at runtime. Dynamic analysis methods
typically have lower false-positive rates compared to static
analysis methods as they can observe the actual behavior of

the application, rather than relying on heuristics.
