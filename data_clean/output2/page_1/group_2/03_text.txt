losses, and reputational damage [1]. Common security threats
across web applications include SQL injection [2], command
injection [3], and cross-site scripting (XSS) [4]. PHP is one
of the most popular server-side programming languages for
developing web applications, powering over 76% of web-
sites [5]. As an interpreted language, PHP offers developers
flexibility and ease of use. However, this flexibility can often
result in security vulnerabilities, making PHP applications
particularly prone to these threats.
