In this paper, we propose PREDATOR, a directed fuzzing
framework equipped with selective dynamic instrumentation for
effective and efficient web application vulnerability detection
and validation. We use static analysis techniques and dynamic
analysis techniques to complement each other. Our lightweight
static analysis provides relevant URLs and parameters of the
directed fuzzing targets and thus facilitates dynamic validation
of static analysis reports. Additionally, we propose a runtime
distance supplementation mechanism and tailored mutation
strategies to address the dynamic features of interpreted
languages like PHP. The evaluation shows PREDATOR effectively
triggers more vulnerabilities and outperforms state-of-the-art
grey-box fuzzers by up to 43.8 times in terms of time to
exposure. Moreover, PREDATOR detects 26 previously unknown
vulnerabilities in real-world applications, further demonstrating
its effectiveness. At the time of writing, 7 of the 26 vulnerabilities
have been confirmed and patched by the corresponding vendors.
