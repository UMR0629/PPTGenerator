Abstract—Web application vulnerabilities continue to pose a
significant challenge. Static analysis is currently the mainstream
approach to this issue, while dynamic analysis is not as widely
used in comparison. However, both techniques have their
limitations. While current static analysis tools are plagued
by high false-positive rates, necessitating fine-grained analysis
and substantial expertise, it is also the case that dynamic
analysis tools are underdeveloped. Current fuzzing-based tools
are often limited by inefficiency in exploring deeper code
locations. Moreover, state-of-the-art grey-box fuzzers often
struggle to capture effective parameters from user interfaces,
thereby failing t to ) explore th the e input space efficiently.
