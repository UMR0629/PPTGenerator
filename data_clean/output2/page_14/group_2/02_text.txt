Dynamic approaches [12-19, 30, 32, 33, 44, 45] are
more relevant to our work. Witcher [16] is a grey-box fuzzer
for web applications and the closest to our work. It uses
code coverage feedback to guide the fuzzing process and
customized bug oracles to detect SQL injection and command
injection vulnerabilities. It collects initial seed inputs and tar-
gets using a crawler to support up to 6 languages. PREDATOR
extends Witcher by introducing an static analysis stage to
identify potential targets and a distance feedback mechanism
to guide the directed fuzzing process. It only focuses on PHP
applications. The reasons are twofold: 1) PHP is the most
popular server-side languages for web development [5], and
2) PHP applications are more vulnerable to taint-style vulner-
abilities [6]. However, the techniques used in PREDATOR can
be easily extended to other languages. WebFuzz [15] uses
static instrumentation to collect code coverage feedback and
employs a crossover method to generate new test cases. It
significantly enlarges the source code of the target application.
PREDATOR does not require any modification to the target
application. BackREST [17] is a closed-source feedback-
driven fuzzer designed for testing RESTful APIs. It conducts
dynamic taint analysis during runtime to support the fuzzing
process. PREDATOR only conducts static analysis before the
fuzzing process to avoid introducing high runtime overhead.
At runtime, PREDATOR only collects distance feedback
and leverages the dependent parameters to improve the
mutation effectiveness. As a concurrent work, Atropos [18]
employs snapshot-based techniques and runtime inference
to detect eight types of vulnerabilities. Another recent work,
Phuzz [19], is a modular fuzzing framework for detecting
5 types of server-side and 2 types of client-side vulnerabilities.
PREDATOR, based on Witcher, only detects three kinds of
vulnerabilities. While developing more bug oracles is not our
primary research objective, it is possible to detect additional
types by migrating the approach of PREDATOR to any other
fuzzing tool.
