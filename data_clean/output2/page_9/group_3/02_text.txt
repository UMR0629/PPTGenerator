To the best of our knowledge, no existing fuzzer encom-
passes a vulnerability scope identical to that of PREDATOR.
Therefore, we compare PREDATOR with various state-of-
the-art fuzzers for different types of vulnerabilities, includ-
ing Witcher [16] and Atropos [18] for SQLi and CMDi
vulnerabilities, Cefuzz [30] for CMDi vulnerabilities, and
WebFuzz [15] for XSS vulnerabilities. To better compare the
performance of PREDATOR with Witcher, we add the XSS
detector to Witcher and denote it as Witcher+. The source
code of Atropos—a concurrent work—is not available at
the time of writing. Cefuzz is closed-source and we are not
able to run it for a direct comparison. We thus borrow the
evaluation results presented in the papers [18, 30] of Atropos
and Cefuzz for a comparison. We manually check the testing
results generated by each tool to confirm if they are true
positives.
