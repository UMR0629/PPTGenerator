Jn summary, the contributions of this paper are as follows:

e We propose PREDATOR, an efficient directed fuzzing
tool for web applications to detect SQL injection,
command injection, and XSS vulnerabilities.

e We introduce novel techniques to enable and enhance di-
rected fuzzing for web applications, including selective
dynamic instrumentation and tailored mutation strategies
guided by parameters and distance.

e We evaluate PREDATOR on 3 test suites and 11 real-
world web applications. The results show that
PREDATOR detects more vulnerabilities and triggers
them more efficiently than state-of-the-art tools.

e We find 26 previously unknown vulnerabilities in real-
world web applications with PREDATOR. At the time of
writing, 7 of them have been patched, 6 new CVE IDs
(CVE-2024-404[47-52]) have been assigned.

To foster the future research in this area, we will release
