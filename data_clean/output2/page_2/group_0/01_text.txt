across multiple sessions and interactions. Although coverage-
guided fuzzers are designed to navigate through these states,
they inadvertently expend energy on non-critical areas instead
of focusing on truly buggy states. As a result, certain errors
that only manifest under specific states or conditions may
remain undetected. Furthermore, with the integration of
various third-party modules and libraries, ensuring thorough
coverage becomes increasingly difficult. Each additional layer
of complexity not only makes it harder to predict application
behavior but also increases the resources and time required
for effective testing. This underscores the need for developers
to complement these methods with more sophisticated testing
strategies, focusing on high-risk code locations instead of
exhaustively exploring all possible states.
