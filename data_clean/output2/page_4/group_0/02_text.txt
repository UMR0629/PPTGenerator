Triggering specific vulnerabilities necessitates manipu-
lating both parameter keys and values [35]. Fuzzers often
struggle when lacking the necessary parameters to target
vulnerabilities. Crawlers extract request parameters from the
user interface but lack insight into the applicationâ€™s internal
logic. Such superficial information fails to assist directed
fuzzers in triggering deeper vulnerabilities.
