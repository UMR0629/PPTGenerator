Challenge 3: Addressing Dynamic Natures of Interpreted
Languages. Directed fuzzing typically requires preparatory
work based on static analysis. For instance, tools utilizing a
distance metric need to initially calculate and assign distances
to basic blocks based on the control flow of the target
application [23, 26]. During dynamic testing, they collect
distance feedback and conduct power scheduling, prioritizing
