which parameters are influential in reaching and testing
different code paths. By analyzing data dependencies, we
can create a targeted input corpus that effectively stimulates
diverse application behaviors during fuzzing. Third, to gather
distance feedback at runtime and leverage it for power
scheduling and seed selection, we need to develop a suitable
instrumentation mechanism.
