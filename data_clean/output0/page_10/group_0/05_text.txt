based approach, making the random tokens deterministic
during fuzzing [18]. We cite Atroposâ€™ detection results in the
best-case scenario as the ground truths used in the evaluation
of Atropos and PREDATOR are not identical. When evaluating
PREDATOR on reproducing known vulnerabilities, we did
not count any true-positive vulnerabilities outside the ground
truth, whereas Atropos did. The current testing results for
Atropos are limited to three synthetic test suites, which
hinders our ability to perform a comprehensive comparison
on real-world applications.
