improving it to maintain fairness in comparison with Witcher.
This is one of the reasons why PREDATOR underperformed
Atropos in detecting SQLi vulnerabilities in bWAPP. The
remaining 3 vulnerabilities could not be triggered by our
current prototype due to the presence of CAPTCHAs and the
requirement of specific User Agent (UA) header values. For
a fair comparison with Atropos, we did not remove hidden
CSRF tokens in DVWA. As Witcher and PREDATOR cannot
handle hidden tokens, they failed to trigger any vulnerabilities
in DVWA. The vulnerabilities undetected in OpenEMR could
be identified by concurrently fuzzing with multiple cores or
increasing the time budget. Moreover, we discovered that
PREDATOR was unable to detect any vulnerabilities within
WordPress, Piwigo and Joomla due to the failure of entry
URL identification. For example, they dynamically includes
server-side files based on the values of query strings, which
are impractical to identify using static analysis methods.
During the XSS vulnerability detection, we noted that the
absence of injected payloads in the source code of some
pages prevented the matching of the attack string. As a
result, PREDATOR failed to detect the vulnerabilities. This
is an implementation limitation of the matching-based XSS
detection method.
