Hvaluation Dataset. We select applications evaluated in
prior studies [6, 12, 15, 16, 30] as our dataset for evaluation.
These encompass 3 synthetic test suites and 11 real-world
applications, comprising around 46K files and 2M LoC in
total. They collectively contain a total of 51 SQL injection
(SQLi), 8 command injection (CMDi), and 26 reflected cross-
site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities. We manually collect
known vulnerabilities from the CVE database [37] in a
best effort manner, yet we acknowledge the possibility of
omissions. We exclude applications that only run on PHP 5,
which has long been obsolete and is no longer supported by
the PHP community. For these applications, we believe that
the benefit of detecting their vulnerabilities is not significant.
