Results. The results are shown in Figure 3. Different colored
bars represent the w7TE required by the corresponding
configuration. A timeout results in a time to exposure of
1 hour. We investigated the performance across 6 different
configurations. The baseline prototype PREDATOR» used
Witcher’s crawler for extracting entry URLs and parameters.
However, it consistently failed to extract any valid entry
URL, thus was unable to trigger any vulnerabilities. With the
implementation of entry URL identification and targeted input
corpus construction, PREDATOR, successfully detected 8 out
of the 13 vulnerabilities. In the remaining 5 cases it failed
