An targeted
input corpus fosters the generation and mutation of test cases
to reach the target code locations effectively. We conduct
an inter-procedural backward data-flow analysis to identify
critical request parameters that may influence the execution
paths (i.e., control flow) of the target application. The input
corpus comprises request parameter keys along with potential
values that can be assigned to them, enabling the fuzzer to
generate test cases effectively. Furthermore, we mark the
parameters that affect the condition expression of a branch
statement as its dependent parameters. These dependent
parameters guide the mutation mechanism, which will be
detailed in ยง4.3.2.
