Bug Oracles. PREDATOR leverages Witcherâ€™s customized
bug oracles to detect SQL injection and command injection
vulnerabilities. A reflected XSS detector is implemented to
demonstrate its potential to detect more types of vulnera-
bilities. However, there are limitations of the current bug
oracles. For example, the current SQL injection oracle only
supports MySQL and PostgreSQL, limiting its applicability
across diverse database environments. The XSS detector
introduces false positives. Additionally, PREDATOR currently
does not support a broader spectrum of vulnerabilities,
such as server-side request forgery (SSRF). This issue
could be addressed by extending the current bug oracles
or implementing PREDATOR upon other fuzzers capable of
detecting more types of vulnerabilities.
