Directed Web Fuzzing. As a directed fuzzer, PREDATOR
guides the fuzzing process towards the target locations. It
requires preparatory work to identify the potential targets.
This is a language-specific task, thus we need to use a
specific static analysis tool for one language. As PHP is the
most popular server-side language for web development [5],
we chose PHP as the target language in our prototype. The
distance feedback mechanism is currently implemented in the
PHP interpreter, which could be extended to other interpreted
languages.
