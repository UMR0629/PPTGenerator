Directed Fuzzing. There are sufficient directed fuzzing
tools for native programs [23-29] and kernels [46-48], yet
few for web applications [30]. Cefuzz [30] claims to be a
directed fuzzer for web applications. Yet its static instru-
mentation method introduces additional code and cannot
accurately evaluate the seeds when the application is complex.
Furthermore, Cefuzz is closed-source, and the evaluation
is limited to a small number of applications. It cannot
address the dynamic features of interpreted languages like
PHP, e.g., the variable function calls. PREDATOR bridges
the gap of the lack of efficient directed fuzzing tools for
web applications without altering the source code of the
