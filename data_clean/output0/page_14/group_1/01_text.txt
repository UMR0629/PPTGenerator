Securing Web Applications. In recent years, many ap-
proaches have been proposed to secure web applications.
Static analysis methods [6, 7, 10, 11, 39-43] scrutinize the
source code of web applications to identify taint-style or
second-order vulnerabilities. Recent work typically based on
code property graph [6, 10] or abstract syntax tree [39, 40]
to model the source code. However, these tools often suffer
from n potential high false positive rates.
