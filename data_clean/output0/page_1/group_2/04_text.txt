To mitigate these threats, security analysts have devel-
oped various techniques to detect vulnerabilities in web
applications. For instance, static analysis methods such as
TChecker [6] and RIPS [7] can scalably screen the source
code to identify suspicious security issues using predefined
heuristics. Unfortunately, they often suffer from potential
high false-positive rates, a situation that is counterproduc-
tive [8-11]. Additionally, even state-of-the-art static analysis
tools may not be able to fully model the dynamic features
of PHP, which can lead to imprecise results [6].
