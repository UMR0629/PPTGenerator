PREDATOR identified a total of 26 new vulnerabilities,
including 11 XSS and 15 SQLi vulnerabilities. PREDATOR
detects new vulnerabilities by validating the reports of static
analysis tools. Specifically, as a directed fuzzer, PREDATOR
sets the target locations based on the static analysis results. If
the target locations do contain vulnerabilities, PREDATOR can
trigger them automatically, thereby reducing the manual ef-
fort needed to validate the static analysis reports. PREDATOR
found no new vulnerabilities in applications such as Word-
Press, phpBB, and Joomla, as the potentially vulnerable
locations identified by TChecker did not contain any vulner-
abilities. This finding is consistent with the results presented
in the paper [6]. We also used Witcher to analyze the
applications with the same time budget, but it only detected
7 out of 26 vulnerabilities. We have responsibly reported
the vulnerabilities to the respective vendors. At the time of
writing, 7 XSS vulnerabilities have been acknowledged and
patched, 6 new CVE IDs (CVE-2024-404[47-52]) have
been assigned.

Our detection approach offers two kev advantages. First.
