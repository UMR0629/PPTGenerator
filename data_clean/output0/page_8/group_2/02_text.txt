Static Analysis. To identify potential targets for dynamic
validation, we utilize TChecker [6]. It is a context-sensitive
inter-procedural static analysis tool to detect taint-style
vulnerabilities in PHP applications. We use the nodes and
edges generated by PHPJoern [10] to construct the abstract
syntax tree (AST) and corresponding graphs to perform
lightweight control- and data-flow analysis.
