To evaluate the effectiveness and efficiency of
PREDATOR, we conducted a comprehensive assessment on
both synthetic and real-world web applications, covering
a wide range of vulnerabilities. Compared to state-of-the-
art fuzzers, PREDATOR detected more vulnerabilities and
triggered them up to 43.8 times faster. We demonstrated that
each component of PREDATOR contributed to the overall
performance. We showcased the effectiveness of PREDATOR
in validating static analysis reports and reducing the manual
auditing efforts. When applying PREDATOR to detect new
vulnerabilities, we identified 26 previously unknown vulnera-
bilities in real-world web applications, 7 of which have been
acknowledged and patched.
