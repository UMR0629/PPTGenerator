PREDATOR outperformed Witcher in 21 out of 25 cases
(highlighted in bold in the table), with p-values less than 0.05.
PREDATOR demonstrated shorter wTTE and successfully
triggered more vulnerabilities in ten attempts. Specifically,
both PREDATOR and Witcher triggered the vulnerability
CVE-2020-29283 in all ten attempts, with PREDATOR
achieving a ITE that was 43.8 times shorter. We observed
that Witcher’s 7TE is marginally lower when detecting
CVE-2020-15713. This can be attributed to the simplicity of
the target vulnerability. Both tools triggered it in seconds, but
the throughput of PREDATOR was relatively lower. Note that
in this experiment we provided Witcher with the entry URLs
and input corpus obtained by PREDATOR. Consequently,
Witcher triggered some vulnerabilities that could not be
identified when using its crawler in Table 3. However, the
input corpus, derived from analyzing the target script, yielded
a greater number of potential parameters than those obtained
using a crawler, thereby expanding the search space. Witcher
was unable to efficiently identify which parameters could
be used to reach the target locations. In contrast, due to
PREDATOR’s directed fuzzing mechanism, it can quickly
identify promising parameter keys and values.
