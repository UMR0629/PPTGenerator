A Promising Approach to Bridge the Gap. Utilizing
directed fuzzing for automated static analysis report valida-
tion shows great promise in web application vulnerability
detection. By leveraging directed fuzzing, we can mitigate the
extensive manual review and validation workload, primarily
induced by the high false-positive rates of static analysis. This
is particularly beneficial for dynamic programming languages
like PHP, where the intricacies and dynamic features pose
modeling challenges for static analysis.
