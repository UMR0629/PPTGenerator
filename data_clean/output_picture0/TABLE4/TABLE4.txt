The results of average time to exposure (u7TTE)
comparison. Each application is denoted by an ID, with the specific
correspondence available in Table 3. T:O. indicates that in all ten
attempts, the vulnerability is not triggered within the time budget.
In other cases, a timeout results in a time to exposure of 24 hours.
Runs denotes the number of successfully triggered attempts. We
mark items where PREDATOR shows superior performance and the
p-value is below 0.05 in bold.
