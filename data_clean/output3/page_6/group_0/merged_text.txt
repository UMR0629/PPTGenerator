inter-procedural control flow of the application to assist in
identifying the entry scripts. Each function along the path
possesses zero, one, or multiple call edges linking it to its
call sites. We meticulously track these call edges to pinpoint
the entry functions and record the scripts in which they are
invoked. These scripts are then marked as entry scripts. If a
target is not within a function body, we consider the scripts
containing the target as entry scripts.
Script Inclusion Chain Analysis. We assess the script
inclusion chain to identify which scripts include the entry
scripts, consequently designating those as entry scripts as
well. Then, we convert the file system paths of the entry
scripts into entry URLs. They are then fed into the fuzzer
to indicate the scripts responsible for processing test cases.
