PHP script, as it introduces new code paths and potential
function calls that are not present or known in static analysis.
Additionally, the included or evaluated code can contain
any number of function calls, conditional statements, or
even additional include or eval statements. PREDATOR treats
include as a jump and eval as a function call.
If we set line 12 in Listing | as the target, PREDATOR
will instrument lines 9, 11, and 12, as they contain the se-
lected opcodes and are path-divergent blocks. The simplified
bytecode of ClassA can be found in Listing 2 in the appendix.

When calculating block distances for PHP applications，
the distance can be inaccurate without executing the Scripts.
Figure 2 illustrates this issue. In this example, vuln_func ()
is the target, and the red numbers indicate the block distance
to the target, which is calculated using SelectFuzz’s block
distance calculation algorithm. This algorithm works on the
inter-procedural control-flow graph (iCFG), however, there
are paths within PHP applications that static analysis tools
cannot identify. We observed that the path represented by
the red dashed directed line in the figure, from line 33
to line 19, is undetectable by static analysis tools. This
leads to an inability to determine the distance between the
basic block at line 33 and the target, resulting in the fuzzer
considering it an unreachable block. When an input causes
the application to execute line 33, the fuzzer does not add
this input to the queue because it does not perceive the input
as reaching a new or closer basic block. Then, the likelihood
of executing the paths represented by all the red arrowed
lines will decrease due to the wrong action, thereby severely
affecting the effectiveness and efficiency of executing target
code and triggering vulnerabilities. We will detail the solution
to this issue in §4.3.1.
