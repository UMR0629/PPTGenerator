In this paper, we present PREDATOR, an efficient directed
fuzzer for web applications. To solve the challenges of
applying directed fuzzing to web applications, PREDATOR
introduces several novel techniques to enable and augment
the directed fuzzing process, especially the block distance
supplementation and the mutation strategies tailored for
web applications. In the evaluation, PREDATOR shows ef-
fectiveness and efficiency in detecting vulnerabilities in
both synthetic and real-world web applications. Moreover,
it finds 26 previously unknown vulnerabilities in real-world
applications and 7 of them are acknowledged and patched
with 6 new CVE IDs assigned. We believe that PREDATOR
can foster research in the field of web application security
and contribute to the development of more sophisticated
directed fuzzers for web vulnerability detection.
