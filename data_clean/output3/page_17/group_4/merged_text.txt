The paper describes a system called PREDATOR, which is
a directed fuzzing framework on PHP, to detect vulnerabilities
using a combination of static and dynamic analysis. Building
on prior work in fuzzing web applications, this paper
proposes uses the output of static analysis, using prior work
TChecker, then using this to drive a fuzzer, using prior work
Witcher, to confirm the vulnerability. While there have been
directed fuzzers in many contexts, this is the first directed
web application fuzzer.
