XSS_ Detection. We further implement a simple re-
flected XSS detector [14, 36] working with PREDATOR, as
Witcher [16] is able to identify only SQL injection and com-
mand injection vulnerabilities. PREDATOR injects a crafted
payload into the target web application and checks whether
the payload is reflected in the response. Technically, we
could employ a JavaScript engine to execute the response for
more accurate detection, similar to what Black Widow [12]
does. However, doing so would significantly impair the
efficiency of the dynamic validation phase, especially for
triggering other types of vulnerabilities. We do not emphasize
this component as our contribution and we only aim to
