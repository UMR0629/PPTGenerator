The key idea of our approach is to mainly adopt
dictionary-based mutation methods when the current input
distance is relatively large, and byte stream-based mutation
methods when the distance gets smaller. PREDATOR uses
Formula | to calculate the probability to use the byte stream-
based mutation methods, where Dx, is the input distance
in the current round, Daoz and Dyin are the maximum and
minimum input distances in the previous rounds, respectively.
The probability is higher when the current distance is smaller,
and lower when the current distance is larger. We set the
maximum probability to 90% based on empirical observation,
meaning that the byte stream-based mutation methods will be
applied with a 90% probability when the current distance is 1.
PREDATOR leverages the maximum and minimum distances
to modulate the rate of change in the probability function,
instead of directly employing a linear function. Specifically,
it mostly chooses byte stream-based mutation methods when
the current distance is sufficiently far from the maximum
distance and sufficiently close to the minimum distance.
