black-box fuzzing (scanning) and grey-box fuzzing. Black-
box scanning operates under the assumption of no prior
internal information about the target web application. For
instance, Black Widow [12] and Enemy of the State [13]
exemplify black-box approaches by modeling navigation and
constructing the state graph of web applications without prior
internal knowledge. On the other hand, grey-box fuzzing
assumes the availability of such information, such as code
coverage feedback. Atropos [18] applies snapshot-based
techniques to fuzz web applications and infers parameter
keys and values at runtime. WebFuzz [15] instruments the
target web applications for code coverage feedback and
Witcher [16] enhances the runtime.
