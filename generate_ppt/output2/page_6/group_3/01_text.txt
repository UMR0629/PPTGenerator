4.4.95. selective Dynamic instrumentation. inspired by se-
lectFuzz [26], we propose to instrument only path-divergent
basic block, which is the last intersection block of a
reachable path and an unreachable one to the target. To
achieve this, PREDATOR needs to perform basic block-level
instrumentation. As discussed in $3, employing traditional in-
strumentation techniques is impractical. Instead, PREDATOR
augments the PHP interpreter to dynamically instrument only
a small group of specific opcodes, as shown in Table |. This
process is transparent to the target application and does not
require any modification to the source code. It contains three
categories of opcodes, i.e., conditional and unconditional
jumps, function calls, and include or eval statements. These
specific opcodes represent the starting point of a basic block.
By instrumenting these opcodes, PREDATOR can provide
precise and efficient monitoring of the execution flow.
