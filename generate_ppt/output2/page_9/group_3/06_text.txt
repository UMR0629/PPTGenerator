COMparison With vylttner, he perrormance improvements
of PREDATOR primarily result from the entry URL identi-
fication and targeted input corpus construction techniques.
For instance, we observed that Witcher struggled to collect
effective entry URLs for some applications, notably bWAPP,
OpenEMR, and rConfig. We conducted additional crawling
for several applications using Witcherâ€™s crawler. However,
after the crawler stopped or reached the time budget, we
observed that the results never included an effective entry
URL for certain vulnerabilities. This is consistent with the
findings in the paper [16].
