Results. Table 2 summarizes the results on synthetic
test suites and Table 3 presents the results on real-world
applications. Combining two datasets, PREDATOR effectively
identified 32 SQL injection vulnerabilities, 5 command
injection vulnerabilities, and 12 XSS vulnerabilities across
all 17 applications. Witcher successfully triggered 16 SQLi
vulnerabilities and 1 CMDi vulnerability, respectively. Ac-
cording to the original papers, Atropos successfully triggered
21 SQLi vulnerabilities and 6 CMDi vulnerabilities in the
synthetic test suites [18]; Cefuzz triggered all 5 CMDi
vulnerabilities in the synthetic test suites [30]. WebFuzz suc-
cessfully identified 9 XSS vulnerabilities, whereas Witcher+
only detected 2. On real-world applications, PREDATOR
detected all vulnerabilities that other tools could detect, and
additionally discovered 9 vulnerabilities that other tools failed
to detect.
