to trigger vulnerabilities in all 10 runs. PREDATOReg further
improved the performance due to the addition of selective
dynamic instrumentation, notably in cases 1, 8, and 10. For
two cases 7 and 11, we observed an increase in 7TE after
enabling block distance supplementation in PREDATORedsï¼Œ
attributable to its runtime overhead. The supplementation
incurs extra overhead as it involves tracking call sites with
unknown callee functions and determining whether the
callees can reach the target. PREDATORedsp managed to
reduce the time cost in most cases, as it mainly adopts
dictionary-based mutation methods in exploration stage and
byte stream-based mutation methods in exploitation stage.
Upon enabling the dependent parameter-sensitive mutation,
PREDATOR improves significantly in cases 6, 11, and 13.
