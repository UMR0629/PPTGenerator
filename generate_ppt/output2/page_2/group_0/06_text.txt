that are closer to predefined high-risk code locations, thereby
avoiding inefficient random state exploration. Moreover,
PREDATOR updates the block distances at runtime to correct
the imprecise static analysis results and enable exploring
more promising paths. PREDATOR employs novel tailored
mutation strategies for web applications, which are guided by
distance and parameters. It probabilistically adopts different
mutation strategies based on the current input distance
to enhance effectiveness in both exploration and exploita-
tion stages. By employing parameter-to-condition analysis,
PREDATOR concentrates mutations on a group of parameters
involved in condition expressions, targeting deeper areas that
current fuzzers struggle to reach.
