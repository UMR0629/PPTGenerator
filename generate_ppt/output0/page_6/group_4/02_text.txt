Jumps. PREDATOR detects the control-flow transfer caused
by either a conditional or unconditional jump. At this point,
the execution stream is at a branch statement, which is the
starting position of a basic block. PREDATOR checks the
file name and starting line number of this basic block to
determine if it is a path-divergent basic block. It updates the
input distance of the current test case if the block distance
is shorter than the current input distance.
