We need to achieve three main tasks using static analysis
techniques. First, we analyze control dependencies to extract
entry URLs for the specified targets and compute block-
level distances. Second, we assess data dependencies to
construct the input corpus. This step involves identifying how
data flows through the application, which helps determine
