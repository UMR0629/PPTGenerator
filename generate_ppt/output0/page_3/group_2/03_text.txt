Note that while vulnerability information can often be
sourced from multiple avenues, such as static analysis tools
and databases of known CVEs, a practical proof of concept
(PoC) to exploit these vulnerabilities frequently remain
unavailable. Therefore, it is crucial to develop a tool capable
of both identifying and effectively triggering these known
vulnerabilities to validate their impact and scope.
