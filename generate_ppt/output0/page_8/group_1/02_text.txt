Distance-Guided Probabilistic Mutation. We propose a
distance-guided probabilistic mutation method that combines
the advantages of both dictionary-based methods [16] and
byte stream-based mutation methods [20]. Dictionary-based
mutation methods can help the exploration stage by changing
the decision of a branch statement. However, for the exploita-
tion stage, these methods may be less effective. Specifically,
when utilizing error-based bug oracles, triggering a vulnera-
bility may require a specific attack string, such as a single
quote for SQL injection.
