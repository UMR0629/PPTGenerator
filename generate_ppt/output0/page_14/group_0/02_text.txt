The capability of PREDATOR to detect new vulnerabilities
relies heavily on the results of static analysis. PREDATOR
can dynamically validate the potential targets to reduce the
false positives, but the false negatives are still a problem.
Unfortunately, many vulnerable locations are not identified
by the current static analysis tools [9]. We observed that
TChecker failed to analyze some applications, possibly due
to the complexity of the applications or its inability to
model new PHP syntax. This is a common problem for
static analysis tools, which we leave for future work.
