We develop new directed web fuzzing techniques to tailor
towards the specific dynamic features of web applications as
they render the fuzzing process inefficient. These techniques
encompass block distance supplementation at runtime and
tailored mutation strategies. Block distance supplementa-
tion assists in updating imprecise block distances during
the fuzzing process, while tailored mutation strategies are
designed to improve the mutation effectiveness.
